# HTTP API

Scrutineer's HTTP endpoints are split by caller and trust boundary. They are not one uniformly authenticated public API: running skills use short-lived scan tokens, host-side operator tools rely on the loopback boundary, and federation peers reach a separately deployed claim-check endpoint.

The complete method, path, parameter, request, and response definitions are in the [OpenAPI document](../openapi.yaml). See the [threat model](../threatmodel.md) for the DNS-rebinding, CSRF, runner, and federation threats these controls address. Developers adding a route should also read the [development guide](development.md#skill-http-api) and add the route to `openapi.yaml`; route coverage tests reject undocumented API handlers. This page explains how callers reach those routes and which authentication rule applies.

## Surfaces

| Surface | Intended caller | Access rule |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/*` | A skill running inside an active scan | Per-scan bearer token |
| `/api/v1/*` | Host-side scripts and operator tooling | No bearer token; loopback Host boundary |
| `/claim-check` | A federation peer through an operator-configured reverse proxy | No bearer token; disabled by default and loopback-only without a proxy |
| `/api/openapi.yaml` | Host-side discovery or a running skill | Loopback access without a token, otherwise a per-scan bearer token |

Scrutineer normally listens on loopback. The Host checks described below are a defence against DNS rebinding, not a replacement for authentication on an internet-facing deployment. Do not publish the browser UI or `/api/v1/*` directly.

## Skill API: `/api/*`

Every skill scan receives a random bearer token when it is enqueued. The worker places it in `context.json` together with the API base URL, scan ID, and repository ID:

```json
{
  "scrutineer": {
    "api_base": "http://host.docker.internal:8080/api",
    "token": "<per-scan token>",
    "scan_id": 42,
    "repository_id": 7
  }
}
```

Requests send the token as an HTTP bearer credential:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

The token is accepted only while its originating scan has status `running`. Repository-, scan-, and finding-scoped handlers also verify that the requested resource belongs to the token's repository. A token from one repository cannot read or modify another repository. Request bodies on this surface are capped at 1 MiB.

The skill API lets an active skill read repository context and prior scan data, validate a report, enqueue repository- or finding-scoped skills, and update finding records. The exact routes and schemas are in [`openapi.yaml`](../openapi.yaml). See [Writing skills](skills.md#calling-scrutineer-from-a-skill) for the workspace-facing contract and examples of bundled skills that use it.

## Operator API: `/api/v1/*`

The `/api/v1` surface is for commands running on the Scrutineer host. It does not accept or require a scan bearer token. Instead, it passes through the same security middleware as the browser UI and rejects a request whose `Host` is not `127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, or `::1` (with or without a port). Browser POST requests through this middleware also check `Sec-Fetch-Site`; non-browser clients such as `curl` do not send that header.

Use a loopback URL from the host:

```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/repositories
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/findings
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/scans
```

This surface includes JSONL exports, repository finding bundles, report imports, operator delete operations, and instance-wide audit exports. Because these routes can read or modify data across the whole instance, they are kept outside the repository-scoped skill API.

Detailed workflows:

- [Importing findings](import.md) covers `POST /api/v1/import`, accepted formats, repository resolution, and revalidation.
- [Encrypted findings sharing](encrypted-sharing.md) covers repository bundles, archival exports, age encryption, and round trips through the import route.
- The [OpenAPI document](../openapi.yaml) defines the JSONL exports, filters, delete operations, and audit endpoints.

## Federation claim check: `/claim-check`

`POST /claim-check` is registered at the server root, not below `/api`. It is disabled unless `federation_salt` is configured. Disabled instances and unsupported methods return `404`, so the endpoint does not advertise whether federation is enabled.

On its normal loopback listener, claim-check has the same Host restriction as the browser UI and `/api/v1`; it does not use scan bearer tokens. Making it available to federation peers is an explicit deployment decision. The recommended reverse proxy should expose only `POST /claim-check` and rewrite the upstream `Host` to the Scrutineer loopback address. Do not proxy the rest of the UI or operator API with it.

See [Federation interchange](interchange.md#claim-check-endpoint) for the hash contract, responses, configuration, and reverse-proxy guidance.

## OpenAPI discovery: `/api/openapi.yaml`

The repository copy of [`openapi.yaml`](../openapi.yaml) is authoritative and is also embedded in the binary. A running server exposes that copy at `GET /api/openapi.yaml` under two access rules:

- A host-side caller using a loopback Host may fetch it without credentials.
- A skill whose container-facing API hostname is not loopback must send its active scan bearer token.

This hybrid rule applies only to OpenAPI discovery. It does not make the rest of `/api/*` available without a token or the rest of `/api/v1/*` available to a container token.
