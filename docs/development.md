## Releasing

The `Release` workflow checks daily at 17:17 UTC and publishes from the latest `main` commit once the most recent release is at least 14 calendar days old. It can also be dispatched manually from `main` for an out-of-cycle release or recovery run. Versions use CalVer (`YYYY.MM.DD.N`): the date comes from the workflow run's creation time, `N` increments when another tag already exists for that date, and retries against the same commit reuse any unpublished version.

Before a release, the `runner-image` workflow for the target commit must have published its multi-platform `sha-<full-commit>` tag. Preflight refuses a version tag that points at a different commit, runs the full Go test suite, and resolves that commit-matched runner manifest to an immutable digest. That digest is injected as the released binary's default runner image, keeping the host and the sidecar-capable runner image on the same source revision. Each platform job builds with `CGO_ENABLED=0`, validates the binary, packages it with the license and README, and generates a GitHub build-provenance attestation. The final job creates `SHA256SUMS`, removes any incomplete same-version drafts, creates a fresh draft tied to the current commit, uploads its complete asset set, and only then publishes it. If the runner image is missing, re-run its workflow before retrying the release. If draft creation, an asset upload, or publication fails, re-run the failed job; the incomplete release remains hidden and the workflow replaces it safely. Re-running an already successful workflow run is a no-op after verification.

The release matrix produces Linux and macOS archives for `amd64` and `arm64`. macOS artifacts are intentionally unsigned and unnotarized until the project adopts an organisation-controlled Apple signing identity and release policy.

## Lint + vuln + deadcode

The full quality sweep:

    golangci-lint run --enable gocritic,gocognit,gocyclo,maintidx,dupl,mnd,unparam,ireturn,goconst,errcheck ./...
    govulncheck ./...
    deadcode ./...

## Adding a new scan type

Scans are claude-code skills on disk; adding one is a directory drop, no Go change. The frontmatter reference, `scrutineer.*` metadata keys, output kinds, workspace layout, `context.json` shape, and schema validation are documented in [skills.md](skills.md).

### When you do need Go changes

- **New output kind**: add the kind to `OutputKinds` in `internal/skills/parse.go`, add a `parseXOutput` method in `internal/worker/skill_parsers.go`, and add a case to the switch in `internal/worker/skill.go`. Without the `OutputKinds` entry the bundled-skills test rejects the SKILL.md at startup.
- **New API surface** for skills to read: add a handler in `internal/web/api_reads.go` and a route in `internal/web/api.go`, then document it in `openapi.yaml`.

## Frontend assets

Tailwind, basecoat, htmx, lucide and highlight.js are vendored under `internal/web/static/vendor/` and embedded into the binary so the UI works offline. To bump a version, edit the pinned URL in `scripts/vendor-assets.sh`, re-run it, update the matching filename in `internal/web/templates/layout.html`, and commit the changed files.

    ./scripts/vendor-assets.sh

## SSE architecture

The `Broker` in `sse.go` fans events from the worker and from the web handlers to connected browsers. Clients subscribe via `GET /events?scan={id}&repo={id}&conv={id}&events={names}` (all optional). The scope parameters filter by subject; `events` is a comma-separated list of event names, so a page that only reacts to job status is not sent the log line of every running scan on the instance. The event types are:

- `scan-log`: each line from a running job, pushed immediately
- `scan-status`: a job left `queued` for `running`, reached a terminal state, or was changed by an operator action (cancel, pause, resume, retry, enqueue)
- `chat-activity` / `chat-done`: a conversation turn's progress and its completion

A `scan-status` carrying a scan ID renders the `scan-status-sse` fragment: an OOB row for the repo Scans tab, plus a toast once the scan finished. A bulk action or a fresh enqueue has no single row to swap, so it publishes the event with a zero scan ID and no payload — the list pages treat it as "re-fetch your table".

Templates use `hx-ext="sse"` with `sse-connect` plus either `sse-swap` (append log lines, swap a row) or `hx-trigger="sse:scan-status"` with `hx-get`. Three tables use the second form and re-request a fragment of themselves, which keeps the operator's scroll, filters and sort: `/scans` swaps `#jobs`, `/` swaps `#repos` (both replay the current request URI, exposed as `.SelfURL`), and a repository's Scans tab swaps `#repo-scans` from `GET /repositories/{id}/scans`. That last one has its own route rather than an `isHX` branch on `repoShow`, which would re-run the findings, dependency, inventory and threat-model loads the table never reads. On `repo_show` the listener keeps its `sse-swap` as well, so a row already on screen still updates instantly and raises its toast; the fragment request is what shows a scan queued after the page was rendered and moves the Cancel/Resume/Retry counts. It is a child of the `sse-connect` element so it can declare its own `hx-swap`, the same shape `scan_show.html` uses for its log pane.

A status event cannot keep an elapsed time honest, since it ages between two events. `since` therefore renders `<time datetime="…" data-elapsed>3m ago</time>` and `static/app.js` recounts every `time[data-elapsed]` once a second, so the value climbs with no request at all. The marker attribute is what keeps the recount off any other `<time>` — a future absolute date, or the `until` helper's "in 3h" — which it would otherwise rewrite as "3h ago". The JS mirrors `humanDuration`; keep the two in step or a value jumps whenever the server re-renders it.

The Scans tab fragment reads a narrowed projection (`scanRowColumns`) rather than whole scan rows: it re-renders on every status event, and a scan's `log` and `report` are megabytes the table never shows. `TestRepoScansFragment_rowMatchesTheFullPage` compares one row rendered through both paths, so a column the projection forgets fails the build instead of silently rendering blank on refresh. Handlers serve those fragments on any htmx request, and deliberately leave the flash cookie alone there since a fragment carries no `#toaster`. Embedded newlines in log lines are emitted as multiple `data:` lines so the browser's EventSource parser reconstructs the original text.

## Skill HTTP API

`/api` is a bearer-authenticated surface that running skills call back into. Each scan gets a random token on enqueue; the worker writes it into the workspace's `context.json`. Middleware (`apiAuth`) validates the token against the active scan row and enforces that a scan only touches resources on its own repository. Direct finding-field PATCHes additionally require the scan's `FindingID` to match the target; finding child records remain repository-scoped for repository-wide skills.

See `openapi.yaml` at the repo root for the full surface. The `triage` bundled skill is the reference example.

## Finding workflow tables

Mutable fields on `Finding` (status, severity, resolution, CVE/CVSS fields, etc.) all write through `db.WriteFindingField`, which logs every change to `FindingHistory` with a source tag (`tool`, `model_suggested`, `analyst`). Skill writes come through the API with `source=model_suggested`; browser-form writes use `source=analyst`. Notes, communications, references, and labels are stored in sibling tables rather than blob columns.

## Security hardening

See [threatmodel.md](../threatmodel.md) for the full model. Key mitigations in the code:

- `securityHeaders` middleware on browser routes: host header check (localhost only) + `Sec-Fetch-Site` on POST
- `/api/*` skips browser CSRF but requires a per-scan bearer token (random 32-byte hex)
- `validateGitURL`: https-only, `--` separator, `GIT_PROTOCOL_FROM_USER=0`
- `io.LimitReader` on the one remaining upstream HTTP call (10 MB cap); skills do their own fetching
- Data directory created with mode `0700`
- `SameSite=Strict` on cookies
