# Diff-Based Rescans

Diff-based rescans are for repositories that have moved since the last scan.
They reuse prior scan context and focus the next run on the changes between a
baseline commit and the new commit.

Use a diff rescan when the project changed: a new release, a branch update, or
a CI-triggered scan after a merge. Use a normal full scan when Scrutineer
changed: new skills, better prompts, new runner images, or a model upgrade.
Full scans are the right way to re-check the whole repository with improved
tooling.

## Starting One

From a repository page, click **Diff rescan**. Scrutineer queues recon,
diff-aware threat-model, semgrep, and security-deep-dive scans as one group.
Threat-model consumes the sibling recon report, and deep-dive waits for the
sibling threat-model and semgrep scans before it runs.

API callers can request diff mode when enqueueing a skill:

```json
{
  "rescan_mode": "diff"
}
```

Set `baseline_scan_id` only when you need to pin a specific baseline. Otherwise
Scrutineer chooses the latest compatible completed scan for that skill.

## What Diff Mode Does

A diff rescan compares the selected baseline scan commit with the current scan
commit, stages the diff for the skill, and asks diff-aware skills to focus on:

- changed files;
- changed entry points, trust boundaries, defaults, routes, parser surfaces, or
  build flags;
- existing findings whose attack chain may have changed;
- new findings introduced by the diff.

Diff mode does not claim full coverage over untouched code. Existing findings
are preserved, and a diff scan will not mark unrelated old findings as "not
observed" just because they were outside the diff.

## Automatic Full-Scan Fallback

Diff mode needs a stable baseline commit and a manageable diff. Scrutineer
automatically runs a full scan instead when:

- no suitable baseline scan exists;
- the baseline commit cannot be reached;
- the repository is local and has no usable git commit identity;
- the patch is too large;
- too many files changed.

The scan records why it fell back so the history still explains what happened.

## Threat Models

Diff-aware threat-model scans update the repository threat model only when the
change is material enough to plausibly alter the security contract. Small diffs
keep their threat-model scan report as evidence, but do not churn the working
model.

Material changes include security documentation, public APIs, authentication or
routing code, parser entry points, configuration defaults, build flags, and
other files that affect how untrusted input reaches security-sensitive code.

## Coverage Metadata

The Scans page (`/scans`) displays coverage completeness separately from execution status. Filter by `complete`, `partial`, or `unknown` using the Completeness menu or, for example, `/scans?completeness=partial&status=done`. Skill and status filters combine with completeness, and the selection persists through sorting, pagination, live refresh, and **Retry all failed**. Pause and resume actions remain instance-wide, as their confirmations state.

Completeness is the worker's recorded assessment of the staged scope, not a claim that the repository is vulnerability-free. Legacy scans with no recorded verdict display as `unknown` and are included in the unknown filter. Full and focus-area scans also remain unknown until their scope can be independently reconciled. Invalid completeness filter values return HTTP 400.

Diff scans record structured coverage metadata on the scan row. The scan page
shows the requested and actual mode, the fallback reason when the run degraded
to a full scan, the changed-file count and patch size, and a collapsible list
of every changed file linked into the in-app code browser at the head commit.

Per-file covered/skipped reporting depends on skills emitting that detail and
is not surfaced yet. Deterministic tools that cannot soundly limit themselves
to the diff should say so in their coverage metadata; they may run as a full
scan or skip themselves depending on the tool and repository.
