# Importing findings from other tools

Scrutineer can ingest vulnerability reports produced by external scanners or written by hand and turn them into the same `Repository`, `Scan`, and `Finding` rows a native scan produces. Imported findings carry through the rest of the workflow unchanged: `verify`, `reachability`, `patch`, `disclose`, and the dedup-on-rescan machinery all treat them as first-class.

The endpoint is `POST /api/v1/import` on the localhost-only `/api/v1` surface, so no bearer token is required and the host-header check applies. The body is sniffed; the format is not in the URL.

## Using it

    curl --data-binary @report.sarif http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/import

The request body is the report itself, up to 16 MiB. The response is JSON:

    {
      "format": "sarif",
      "results": [
        {
          "repository_id":     42,
          "repository":        "https://github.com/example/widget",
          "scan_id":           1024,
          "tool":              "CodeQL",
          "created":           5,
          "observed":          2,
          "received":          7,
          "accepted":          7,
          "dropped_per_rule":  0,
          "dropped_total_cap": 0,
          "finding_ids":       [301, 302, 303, 304, 305]
        }
      ]
    }

`created` counts findings inserted on this call; `observed` counts findings that already existed with the same fingerprint and had their `seen_count` bumped. A SARIF file with several runs, or a CSV grouping rows under several `Repository` slugs, returns one result per repository.

`received` counts the findings the parser produced, `accepted` counts those that survived the scanner caps described below, while `dropped_per_rule` plus `dropped_total_cap` say how many each cap rejected. Only the scanner-export formats are capped, so a curated format reports `received` equal to `accepted` with both drop counts zero. `created` plus `observed` can still be lower than `accepted` because identical findings within one report collapse onto a single fingerprint before anything is written.

When the report carries no repository (most pentest writeups, the minimal-JSON shape with `repository: ""`), pass `?repo=<https-url>`:

    curl --data-binary @pentest.md "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/import?repo=https://github.com/example/widget"

`?repo=` always wins over any provenance in the body, so it doubles as an override when a CodeQL run reports the wrong URL.

Each import becomes one `Scan` row per repository with `kind = import` and `skill_name` set to the producing tool's name, so imported findings show up in the scans list alongside native runs and link back to a parent the UI can render. The scan row's `started_at` and `finished_at` are both set to upload time; `status` is `done` immediately.

Re-importing the same report against the same repository upserts: findings with a matching fingerprint update `last_seen_scan_id`, bump `seen_count`, and clear the missed-count counter. Nothing is duplicated and nothing is deleted. Findings that were imported once and not present in a later import simply do not get observed; the existing miss-count machinery is the right tool for "the upstream scanner no longer flags this" and it is left to the operator to run `verify` if they want to confirm.

## Bounded scanner imports

A scanner export is raw scanner output, which is unbounded. One over-eager CodeQL or Semgrep rule can fire thousands of times against a single repository, so without a limit every one of those hits becomes a `Finding` row plus a `revalidate` job that chains into `verify`. Two caps bound that:

| Cap | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Per rule | 5 | The most findings one `rule_id` may contribute to one result. |
| Per result | 50 | The most findings one result may contribute in total, whatever the spread of rules. |

Both are per result, which is one repository's findings from one tool: a multi-run SARIF file is capped per run while a multi-repo CSV is capped per repository, so one upload's ceiling is the per-result cap times the number of results it parses to. The budget is deliberately not shared across the upload, since one repository's noise would otherwise starve another repository's findings out of the same file.

The caps apply to the formats carrying raw scanner output: SARIF plus the code-scanning CSV export and the hosted-scanner markdown export. Every other format is somebody's considered list of findings rather than raw rule output: a hand-written minimal-JSON report and scrutineer's own [sharing bundle](encrypted-sharing.md) both import whole. The `ingest` skill fallback for unrecognised payloads is likewise uncapped, since its output is a model-normalised report rather than a rule dump.

Selection is by input order: the first five hits of a rule and the first fifty findings of a result are the ones kept. The same report therefore always truncates the same way, so re-uploading it after a fix changes nothing about which findings you see while an operator can say exactly which hits were dropped by reading the report top to bottom. A SARIF result that carries no `ruleId` is grouped by its title instead, which is the rule's short description whenever the parser could resolve a rule for it; the per-result cap backstops the case where it could not. A CSV export carries the per-alert Finding URL in `rule_id`, which is unique per row, so it is ignored as a grouping key for the same reason and the alert's `Name` or `Category` column stands in; keying on the URL straight would put every row in its own bucket and leave the per-rule cap inert for that whole format. A row that fills neither column falls back to the URL after all, since an empty key is shared: it would group alerts that have nothing to do with each other and drop everything past the fifth, where the URL merely leaves the per-result cap as their only bound.

A finding both caps would reject is counted against the per-rule cap only, so `dropped_per_rule` plus `dropped_total_cap` equals `received` minus `accepted` rather than double-counting. When either count is non-zero the server logs one warning line per bounded result, carrying the same counters and the cap values in force; it never logs a line per dropped finding.

Accepted findings are imported exactly as they always were. There is no privileged verdict and no lifecycle shortcut for surviving the cap: the fingerprint upsert, the revalidation funnel below, and `verify` all treat a bounded import identically to an unbounded one. Dropped findings are never written, so they queue no work either.

The caps are deliberately blunt. Their job is to keep one noisy rule from burying the findings list and burning model spend before anybody has looked at the first five hits. When a rule's first five hits turn out to be real, the answer is to fix them and re-import, not to raise the cap.

## Revalidation on import

Each *newly-created* finding is enqueued for a `revalidate` run — the cheap classifier that triages an external tool's unvalidated severity claim and, when it confirms a High/Critical true positive, chains into the heavier `verify`. This runs over every imported finding regardless of severity (a native deep-dive only revalidates its own High/Critical output, but an import's severity is an outside claim worth checking even when it reads Low). Re-observed findings — those matching an existing fingerprint — are left alone, and a revalidate already queued or running for a finding is never double-queued.

A remote repository first seen through an import also gets one repository-scoped `metadata` run. That run clones the source through the normal cache path and populates the repository row, so an imported repository is not left as a URL plus findings until somebody manually verifies one. Reimporting an existing hollow repository repairs it; a completed or in-flight metadata run is never duplicated. This onboarding is independent of `?revalidate=false`, which controls only finding-level classification.

An imported `file://` repository is usable only when that exact local directory exists on the receiving host. If it does not, the import is rejected instead of creating an unusable repository row. Supply `?repo=https://forge/owner/repo` to replace sender-local provenance with a cloneable URL. Reimporting the same old bundle without that override cannot change its embedded repository value.

To import without priming this funnel, pass `?revalidate=false`:

    curl --data-binary @bundle.json "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/import?revalidate=false"

The findings still land and no finding-level work is enqueued. A remote repository may still receive the single metadata onboarding run described above. The natural use is ingesting findings that have already been through an audit elsewhere — a trusted [sharing bundle](encrypted-sharing.md) arrives carrying the producer's full audit narrative (`boundary`, `validation`, `prior_art`, `reach`, `rating`), so re-running even the cheap classifier on it is redundant spend. The default is `revalidate=true`; a value that is neither `true`/`false` nor `1`/`0` is rejected with `400` rather than silently treated as on, so a caller that meant to disable the funnel is never billed for it by a typo. (The toggle has no effect on the unrecognised-format fallback below: those findings come from the `ingest` skill asynchronously and are not put through the import-time enqueue.)

## Unrecognised formats

A body that matches none of the formats below is not rejected outright. When `?repo=` is supplied, the payload is handed to the `ingest` skill instead: the raw bytes are staged into the skill's workspace at `import/report`, the repository is cloned alongside at `./src`, and the model normalises whatever the report is (a scanner's bespoke JSON, a pentest write-up, a pasted email) into findings, verifying each claimed location against the checkout. The response is `202 Accepted` with the queued `scan_id`:

    {
      "format":        "unrecognised",
      "repository_id": 42,
      "repository":    "https://github.com/example/widget",
      "scan_id":       1031,
      "skill":         "ingest",
      "status":        "queued"
    }

Findings land asynchronously when the scan completes, through the same fingerprint upsert as every skill run. Without `?repo=` there is nothing to clone (an unparseable body has no readable provenance), so the request still fails with `422`. The skill treats the report as untrusted input: its output is schema-validated like any skill report, and instructions embedded in the report body are ignored rather than followed.

## Supported formats

The detector reads the first few bytes of the body and dispatches:

| Format | Detection rule |
|---|---|
| SARIF 2.1.0 | Valid JSON with a top-level `runs` array. |
| Minimal JSON | Valid JSON with a top-level `findings` array. |
| Findings CSV | First row contains the columns `Severity`, `Repository`, `Name`, `Description`. |
| Findings markdown | Body starts with `# `, contains at least one `## ` section, and at least one `**Key:** value` metadata line. |

### SARIF 2.1.0

The format most scanners emit: CodeQL, Semgrep, Snyk, Checkmarx, anything that follows GitHub's code-scanning conventions. Each `runs[]` entry becomes one `Result`. The repository URL is taken from `versionControlProvenance[0].repositoryUri`; the tool name from `tool.driver.name`.

Per-result mapping:

| Scrutineer field | SARIF source |
|---|---|
| `title` | `rule.shortDescription.text`, falling back to `rule.name`, then `result.message.text`, then `ruleId`. |
| `description` | `result.message.text`, falling back to `rule.fullDescription.text`. |
| `severity` | `rule.properties.security-severity` interpreted as a CVSS v3 base score (>=9 critical, >=7 high, >=4 medium, >0 low), falling back to `result.level` (`error` -> high, `warning` -> medium, `note`/`none` -> low). |
| `confidence` | `rule.properties.precision` (`very-high`/`high` -> high, `medium` -> medium, `low` -> low). Empty when absent. |
| `cwe` | First matching `cwe` tag in `rule.properties.tags`. Matches `CWE-79`, `cwe-79`, and `external/cwe/cwe-079`. |
| `location` | `result.locations[0].physicalLocation`: `artifactLocation.uri` plus `region.startLine` (and `startColumn` when present). |
| `suggested_fix` | `result.fixes[0].description.text` when present. |

Severity defaulting in SARIF is deliberately conservative: when the producer left both fields empty, scrutineer stores an empty severity and the UI shows it as such rather than guessing.

The import caps apply to SARIF; see [Bounded scanner imports](#bounded-scanner-imports) above for what a run contributes at most and how the truncation is reported.

### Minimal JSON

A small shape for hand-written pentest reports and tools with no SARIF emitter.

    {
      "repository": "https://github.com/example/widget",
      "commit": "deadbeef",
      "tool": "pentest-2026q2",
      "findings": [
        {
          "title": "Path traversal in download endpoint",
          "cwe": "CWE-22",
          "severity": "critical",
          "confidence": "high",
          "location": "src/handlers/download.js:88",
          "description": "filename parameter is joined to the static root without normalisation.",
          "patch": "--- a/src/handlers/download.js\n+++ b/src/handlers/download.js\n@@\n- const p = path.join(root, req.query.filename)\n+ const p = path.join(root, path.basename(req.query.filename))\n"
        }
      ]
    }

`tool` defaults to `manual` if absent. `title` is the only field worth always supplying; the rest are optional and left empty when missing.

`patch` is folded into the finding's description (the audit trace) rather than written to `suggested_fix`, which is reserved for diffs that have passed the patch-applicability gate — an imported diff is an unverified lead until a `patch` run promotes it. When `fix_commit` is present it is noted alongside the folded diff so a later `patch` run knows the base to rebase onto.

Scrutineer's own encrypted-sharing bundle ([encrypted-sharing.md](encrypted-sharing.md)) is this same shape, enriched with the fields it round-trips between instances. Every bundle adds a per-finding `commit` (falls back to the top-level `commit` when absent), `sub_path`, the full `locations` set, `sinks`, `vid`, `reachability`, `quality_tier`, `fix_commit`, `model` (the producing scan's model on the exporting instance, preserved as the imported finding's model — dropped on import unless it looks like a model id, since bundle text is externally supplied and the value feeds the reporting CSV), and the audit-narrative fields `boundary`, `validation`, `prior_art`, `reach` and `rating`. Findings from the deterministic importers carry no model attribution — the synchronous import scan records no model of its own — whereas the `ingest` skill fallback stamps its findings with its own ingest model like any skill run.

An `include=all` bundle adds the archival superset: `snippet`, `affected`, `fix_version`, `cve_id`, `ghsa_id`, `cvss_vector`/`cvss_v4_vector` (the derived scores are recomputed from the vectors on import, never read from the bundle), `mitigation`/`mitigation_semgrep`, `breaking_change`/`breaking_change_rationale`, `dup_check`, `disclosure_draft`, `exploited_in_wild`/`exploited_in_wild_evidence`, the real `upstream_fix_commit` (its own key, since `fix_commit` already carries the patch base), and the finding's `notes`, `communications`, and `references` child records. On import the child records are attached to the finding; re-importing the same bundle onto a finding that already exists content-dedupes them rather than piling up duplicates.

Hand-written reports may supply any of these, but none are required, and the top-level `generated_at` a bundle carries is ignored on import.

### Findings CSV

The export shape GitHub's code-scanning UI produces, plus close variants. The required columns are `Severity`, `Repository`, `Name`, `Description`; the parser also reads `Status`, `Category`, `File path`, `Line`, `Confidence`, `CWE`, and `Finding URL` when present, and any extra columns are ignored.

Rows whose `Status` column is anything other than `Open` (case-insensitive) are skipped: dismissed and resolved entries are not pulled in. Rows are grouped by `Repository`, so a single CSV with findings against three repos yields three results.

`Repository` is read as either a full URL or a `owner/repo` slug; bare slugs are expanded to `https://github.com/<slug>` since the producer of this export shape is GitHub-only. The tool name is the host of the `Finding URL` column; an export that omits it falls back to the literal string `csv`.

The import caps apply to this format; see [Bounded scanner imports](#bounded-scanner-imports) above. Each `Repository` group is one result, so each carries its own budget.

### Findings markdown

The export shape some hosted scanners produce, with one finding per H1 heading followed by an H2 section per fact:

    # Path traversal in download URL

    ## Details
    The download URL generation interpolates parsed components into URL paths...

    ## Location
    [download_url.rb:97](https://github.com/example/widget/blob/main/download_url.rb#L97)

    ## Impact
    ...

    ## Reproduction steps
    1. ...

    ## Recommended fix
    Components that were percent-decoded during parsing must be re-encoded...

    ---
    **Severity:** MEDIUM
    **Status:** Open
    **Category:** Path traversal
    **Repository:** example/widget
    **Branch:** main

`Location` is parsed twice: the link text becomes the `file:line` location, and the link target (when it is a forge blob URL like `https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/...`) yields the repository URL. The `**Repository:**` metadata line is the fallback. `Details`, `Impact`, and `Reproduction steps` are concatenated into `description`; `Recommended fix` becomes `suggested_fix`.

The tool name for markdown imports is the literal string `markdown` since the export format carries no producer field.

The import caps apply to this format; see [Bounded scanner imports](#bounded-scanner-imports) above.

## What happens after the upload

The flow is the same regardless of format:

1. **Detect and parse.** `ingest.Parse` sniffs the body, picks a parser, and returns `[]Result`. Each `Result` is one batch of findings against one repository.
2. **Bound raw scanner output.** A result parsed from a raw scanner format (SARIF, the code-scanning CSV export or the hosted-scanner markdown export) is trimmed to the per-rule and per-result caps before anything is written; every other format passes through whole. See [Bounded scanner imports](#bounded-scanner-imports) above.
3. **Resolve the repository.** `?repo=` if present, otherwise `Result.RepoURL`. The URL is normalised through `ParseRepoInput` (the same path the UI uses) and a `Repository` row is created on first sight.
4. **Create the scan row.** One per `Result`, with `kind = import`, `status = done`, `skill_name = <tool>`, `findings_count = len(findings)` (the accepted findings, after any capping). The scan's `commit` is `Result.Commit` when the format carried one (SARIF `versionControlProvenance`, minimal-JSON `commit`).
5. **Upsert findings.** Each parsed finding is fingerprinted with the tool name in the skill-name slot and its sub-path (`db.FingerprintFinding(tool, sub_path, cwe, location, title)`), then matched against existing rows by `(repository_id, fingerprint)`. The sub-path is empty for every format except scrutineer's own bundle, so their fingerprints are unchanged; carrying it keeps two findings at the same location in different monorepo sub-projects from collapsing onto one fingerprint. Match found: `last_seen_scan_id`, `last_seen_commit`, `seen_count` are updated and a `FindingHistory` row is written. No match: a new `Finding` row is created with `imported_from = <tool>`. Whatever fix an ingest carries — the `suggested_fix` a parser extracted from a SARIF/markdown report, or the minimal/bundle `patch` — is folded into the finding's trace prose, not written to the `suggested_fix` column, which is reserved for diffs a `patch` run has put through the applicability gate. An `include=all` bundle also carries `notes`, `communications` and `references`; these are attached to the finding after it is created (or, on a re-import onto an existing finding, appended only where an identical record does not already exist). References are matched on their URL alone rather than on their whole content, because `(finding_id, url)` is unique: a bundle naming a URL the finding already carries leaves the stored row alone whatever tags or summary it puts on it, and a bundle naming one URL twice writes it once.
6. **Prime the funnel.** Each newly-created finding is enqueued for `revalidate` (which chains into `verify` on a confirmed High/Critical), unless `?revalidate=false` was passed. See [Revalidation on import](#revalidation-on-import) above.

The full column set is in [database.md](database.md); the `Finding.ImportedFrom` field is what distinguishes imported findings from native ones. The scans index filters on `kind = import` to show only imports, and imported findings appear in the main Findings list by default, alongside audit findings. An import is operator-submitted rather than a scanner this instance runs on its own schedule, so it is not hidden behind the scanners toggle. A raw scanner export is bounded before it gets there: SARIF, the code-scanning CSV and the hosted-scanner markdown are trimmed to the per-rule and per-result caps ([Bounded scanner imports](#bounded-scanner-imports)) before anything is written, so the list shows a rule's first few hits rather than every hit it produced.

## Adding support for a new format

The parser contract is small. Each format implements one function:

    func parseFoo(data []byte) ([]Result, error)

returning one `Result` per repository. The `Result` and `Finding` shapes are in `internal/ingest/ingest.go`; populate what the format gives you and leave the rest empty. The web layer is responsible for normalising severity defaults, choosing a repository when provenance is missing, and creating scan and finding rows; the parser only translates.

Wire the format in two places:

1. **`internal/ingest/ingest.go`**. Add a `Format` constant, a `case` in `detect`, and a `case` in `Parse`. `detect` should match on cheap cues (a top-level JSON key, a magic byte, a header row); it sees the full body but should not parse it twice. Return the new `Format` only on a positive identification, never as a fallback, because the dispatch in `Parse` treats an empty `Format` as `ErrUnrecognised` and a wrong identification produces a misleading error.
2. **`internal/ingest/foo.go`**. Implement `parseFoo`. If detection needs more than a top-level key (a CSV header check, an XML root element), put the helper alongside.

Conventions worth following:

- **Severity vocabulary.** Lowercased: `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, or empty. The CSV parser shows the pattern.
- **CWE format.** `CWE-79`, not `cwe-79` or `CWE-079`. Use `normaliseCWE` in `csv.go`.
- **Location format.** `file:line` or `file:line:column`, relative to the repository root. SARIF's `URI` field is already in this shape.
- **Tool name.** Take it from the report itself wherever possible; the response payload exposes it as `tool` and it becomes `Finding.ImportedFrom`. Falling back to the format name (`csv`, `markdown`) is acceptable when the producer is anonymous.
- **Skipping.** Drop dismissed or withdrawn entries inside the parser; the upsert layer has no way to know they should not exist.
- **Provenance.** When the format carries `commit` set `Result.Commit`; it becomes the scan's commit and the suggested-fix base.

Add a fixture under `internal/ingest/testdata/` and a test in `internal/ingest/ingest_test.go` that calls `Parse` against the fixture and asserts on field-level mapping; the existing SARIF, CSV, and markdown tests are the templates.

CSAF and OSV are intentionally deferred. CSAF round-trips against scrutineer's own export but the inverse is not a straight inversion: `product_status` buckets, VEX flags, and the per-product justifications do not map cleanly onto a single `Finding` row. OSV is closer to a fit but its `affected[]` shape is package-oriented rather than code-oriented, so a sensible Finding `location` field needs a heuristic. Both are worth doing; neither is a mechanical write.
