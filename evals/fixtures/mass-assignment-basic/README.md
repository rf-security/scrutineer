# Mass-assignment fixture

The member-only `/account` route in `account.py` validates only the JSON shape,
then passes the full request body to `account.update(body)`. A member can
therefore set server-owned fields such as `role` or `owner_id`.

The `/profile` route in `profile.py` is the paired negative case. It copies
only an explicit allow-list of editable fields and overwrites `owner_id` from
the authenticated principal, so it must not produce a mass-assignment finding.
