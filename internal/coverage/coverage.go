// Package coverage defines the typed contract stored in Scan.Coverage: what
// a scan did and did not reach, and how confident the worker is in that.
//
// The column was an ad-hoc JSON blob with two owners writing different shapes
// into it (the diff-rescan staging path in internal/worker and the
// threat-model update path in internal/web), so a consumer could not tell
// "no findings after a complete scan" from "no findings in the part that
// finished". A Record is that distinction, written by every scan mode.
//
// Completeness is derived by the worker from receipt reconciliation against
// the scope it staged itself, never from the skill's own claim about how much
// it covered. Where the worker has no independently known scope, the honest
// answer is CompletenessUnknown, not CompletenessComplete.
