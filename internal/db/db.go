// has always shown and makes the merge deterministic: the same database always
// produces the same rows, whatever order the duplicates were written in. The
// survivor absorbs any tags and summary it is missing from the rows being
// removed, oldest first, so metadata a later duplicate carried is not lost with
// the row that carried it. Values already on the survivor always win; the merge
// never overwrites one reference's metadata with another's.
//
// URLs are trimmed as they are grouped, because AddFindingReference trims
// before it looks a row up: a stored " https://x " would never match a write of
// "https://x" and the index would happily keep both, leaving exactly the
// duplicate this migration exists to remove. Tags and summary are trimmed on
// the survivor for the same reason, to leave every row in the shape the helper
// writes today. A row whose URL is blank once trimmed is deleted rather than
// kept, since it points nowhere and no writer can produce one any more.
//
// The merge and the index creation are one unit of work, which is what makes
// the repair safe to interrupt. Leaving the index to AutoMigrate would commit
// the deletions first and build the index in a later statement, so a schema
// step that failed in between would return an error from Open having already
// dropped rows the operator cannot get back. The index is the only reason those
// rows were removed: either the table ends up collapsed and constrained, or it
// ends up untouched. SQLite rolls DDL back with the rest of a transaction, so a
// CREATE INDEX that fails takes the deletes with it. AutoMigrate then finds the
