// /reporting is the corpus-wide reporting page: a running total of scan
// activity over a rolling window, alongside the cost and token averages
// that docs/cost_averages.sql computes from the command line.
//
// It deliberately overlaps /usage only on the averages. /usage answers
// "which skill costs what" by slicing cost per skill and per day; this
// page answers "what has the corpus done lately" and pairs that with the
// single-number averages, so the two can be read side by side. Both draw
// on the same cost_usd/*_tokens columns the worker writes.
//
// The cost averages are computed SQL-side so the GORM query maps clause
// for clause onto docs/cost_averages.sql, and so a growing corpus is not
// read into memory to be averaged. AVG/COUNT are standard SQL and survive
// the PostgreSQL driver swap internal/db documents.
//
// The day bucketing is the one thing done in Go: grouping by calendar day
// needs date()/strftime()/date_trunc, which differ per dialect and would
// pin this file to SQLite. /usage bins its days in Go for the same reason.
