// protect the file a finding lives in, resolved on the host and staged into
// context.json for the verify skill.

// Like novelty, this is deterministic host-side evidence rather than a
// verdict. The worker decides which controls match, because matching is a
// glob evaluation with a namespace precondition that the skill has no way to
// get right from inside the container; what the controls *mean* for the
// finding is the skill's job.
//
// Only matched controls are staged, never the whole model. A verify run is
// scoped to one finding, and handing it every control in the repository
// invites it to re-derive the match in prose — the exact non-determinism
// resolving it on the host is meant to remove.
