// bindMount builds a `-v` value "src:dst[:opts]" for a runner bind mount,
// appending the SELinux relabel option "z" when relabel is true. opts carries
// any non-SELinux options (e.g. "ro"); "z" joins that comma-separated group, so
// an SELinux host gets "src:dst:ro,z" while every other host gets the spec
// unchanged.
//
// Why ":z" (shared) and not ":Z" (private):
//
//   - Host read-back. After a scan the scrutineer host process reads the output
//     report back out of /work (readCappedReport). ":z" relabels to the shared
//     type container_file_t with no MCS category, so the host can still read it;
//     ":Z" stamps a private per-container category that a host process in a
//     confined SELinux domain could be denied -- locking scrutineer out of the
//     very report it asked for.
//   - Overlapping mounts. /work and /src point at the same clone tree; one
//     shared label keeps the two relabels consistent instead of churning a
//     private category between them.
//   - Isolation model. scrutineer separates scans with per-scan work roots and,
//     under --hardened, per-scan --internal networks -- not SELinux MCS. ":Z"'s
//     extra container-to-container separation is not load-bearing here. The cost
//     ":z" accepts is that any container_t on the host could read a scan's
//     ephemeral workspace; that is outside the threat model (the concern is a
//     hostile repo escaping the sandbox, not a sibling local container reading a
//     throwaway clone).
//
// Operators who want the stricter per-scan MCS isolation can pre-label their data
// dir and run with --selinux=off; ":Z" is intentionally not exposed as a switch
// so the host read-back guarantee stays simple.

// the per-scan network enforcement --hardened needs), and the runner verifies
// that fail-closed per scan (see Runtime.NeedsHardenedNetVerify). The one flag
// Apple's CLI does not expose is --security-opt no-new-privileges, but on a
// VM-per-container runtime the VM boundary is the isolation, not in-guest
// privilege hardening: an escalated process is still trapped in a disposable VM
// with no host filesystem or credentials. Apple's own untrusted-code sandbox
// (containerization's examples/sandboxy) hardens exactly this way -- VM +
// read-only mounts + host-only network + allowlisting proxy, no
// no-new-privileges. So --hardened is accepted; only --hardened-runtime-only
