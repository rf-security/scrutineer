# Java and JVM injection reference

Load for Java, Kotlin, Scala, Spring, Jackson, SnakeYAML, Log4j, Freemarker,
Velocity, JSP/EL, scripting engines, native serialization, and process builders.

## Version facts to check

- SnakeYAML before 2.0 defaulted to a constructor capable of creating arbitrary
  Java objects when callers used `new Yaml()` or `Constructor`. SnakeYAML 2.0
  changed defaults toward `SafeConstructor`; still verify explicit constructors
  and type descriptions. Source:
  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1834409
- Jackson `enableDefaultTyping` and `@JsonTypeInfo(use = Id.CLASS)` are unsafe
  when untrusted JSON can select classes. Jackson 2.10 introduced
  `PolymorphicTypeValidator`; absence of an allowlist is the key issue. Source:
  https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Release-2.10
- Log4Shell CVE-2021-44228 JNDI RCE was fixed in 2.15.0 for Java 8+ lines,
  with follow-on fixes in 2.16.0 and 2.17.0/2.17.1 for related lookup/JDBC
  cases. Only report logging of attacker strings here when the project is on a
  vulnerable Log4j line and the relevant lookup behavior is enabled/reachable.
  Sources: https://logging.apache.org/security.html and
  https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/release-notes.html
- Spring4Shell CVE-2022-22965 needs Spring Framework 5.3.0-5.3.17,
  5.2.0-5.2.19, JDK 9+, and a vulnerable binding/deployment shape such as WAR
  on Tomcat. Do not report generic Spring binding without those conditions.

- Apache Commons Text string interpolation RCE is fixed in 1.10.0; earlier
  `StringSubstitutor` with dangerous lookups can execute commands or scripts.
  Source: https://security.apache.org/blog/cve-2022-42889/
- XStream 1.4.18 switched to a whitelist by default; versions before 1.4.18
  should be treated as unsafe for untrusted XML unless the application already
  configures a strict whitelist. Source: https://x-stream.github.io/security.html

## Dangerous APIs

- Command execution: `Runtime.getRuntime().exec(String)`, `ProcessBuilder`
  invoking `sh -c`, `bash -c`, `cmd.exe /c`, and wrappers concatenating one
  command string.
- Dynamic execution: `ScriptEngine.eval(user)`, Spring SpEL
  `parseExpression(user).getValue()`, MVEL/OGNL/JEXL expression evaluation,
  reflection dispatch from user-selected class or method names, and dynamic
  class loading.
- Deserialization: `ObjectInputStream.readObject` on network/request bytes,
  unrestricted Jackson polymorphic typing, SnakeYAML unsafe constructors,
  XStream before hardened allowlists, and Hessian/Kryo/FST on untrusted bytes.
- Templates: Freemarker/Velocity/Thymeleaf template source or expression text
  controlled by a user, dynamic template path selection outside an allowlist,
  and exposed utility classes such as Freemarker `Execute`.

## Safe or non-reportable forms

- `new ProcessBuilder("git", "clone", "--", userUrl)` with a literal program
  does not invoke a shell.
- Jackson binding into a concrete DTO without default typing is not object
  construction RCE.
- SnakeYAML with `SafeConstructor` or schema-bound primitive DTOs is normally
  safe.
- Logging user strings on Log4j 2.17.1+ is not Log4Shell.
