# PHP injection reference

Load for PHP, Symfony, Laravel, Twig, Blade, PHAR metadata, dynamic includes,
process helpers, `eval`/`assert`, and `unserialize`.

## Version facts to check

- `assert($string)` evaluated strings as PHP code through `eval()` before PHP
  8.0. The string form was deprecated in 7.2 but still dangerous in 7.2-7.4
  when enabled; it was removed in 8.0. Source:
  https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.assert.php
- `unserialize($user)` remains unsafe on untrusted input in all PHP versions
  when gadget classes with `__wakeup`, `__destruct`, `__toString`, or similar
  magic methods are available. `allowed_classes=false` materially changes risk.
  Source: https://www.php.net/function.unserialize.php
- PHAR metadata deserialization bugs were reduced in PHP 8.0 by stopping
  automatic metadata unserialization in many file operations, but explicit
  PHAR metadata reads and older PHP versions remain risky. Sources:
  https://wiki.php.net/rfc/phar_stop_autoloading_metadata and
  https://www.php.net/manual/en/phar.getmetadata.php
- `preg_replace` with the `/e` modifier evaluates replacement text as PHP
  code. It was deprecated in PHP 5.5 and removed in PHP 7.0, so only report it
  for legacy PHP runtimes where the modifier is still supported. Source:
  https://wiki.php.net/rfc/remove_deprecated_functionality_in_php7
- Twig autoescaping protects output data, not attacker-controlled template
  source. `createTemplate(userText)` or `template_from_string` are SSTI sinks.
- Laravel Blade compiles trusted server templates to PHP. A user-controlled
  Blade template source or include path is code execution.

## Dangerous APIs

- Command execution: `system`, `exec`, `shell_exec`, `passthru`, `popen`,
  backticks, Symfony Process built from one shell string, and shell wrappers
  containing request data.
- Dynamic code and includes: `eval`, `assert` string evaluation on old PHP,
  legacy `preg_replace` with `/e`, `include`/`require` on
  attacker-controlled paths, `call_user_func` over an untrusted callable, and
  dynamic class names reaching privileged constructors.
- Deserialization: `unserialize`, `Phar` metadata reads on attacker-controlled
  archives, Symfony/Laravel serializer modes that instantiate classes from
  input, and custom object hydrators using user-supplied class names.
- Templates: Twig `createTemplate`, `template_from_string`, Smarty string
  resources, Blade compilation of tenant-supplied text, and request-controlled
  view names outside a closed allowlist.

## Safe or non-reportable forms

- `escapeshellarg` plus a fixed command can mitigate shell metacharacters, but
  still check option injection and missing `--` for sensitive binaries.
- Twig/Blade rendering user variables through fixed server-owned templates is
  not SSTI.
- `json_decode` and Symfony Serializer into a concrete DTO are not object
  construction RCE by themselves.
- `unserialize($data, ["allowed_classes" => false])` blocks object gadgets.
